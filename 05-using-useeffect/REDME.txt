Learned fetched data show once page load and achive this using useEffect hook, called the fetchMoviesHandler function inside
useEffect. for dependancies I just passed handler funtion because useEffect is depends on that handler function. but while
passing handler function as dependency to useEffect it take infinite loop, because the function passed as object that reference type 
so for handling the and stop unneccessary calls of the handler function I just used useCallback hook, just wrapped the handler function inside
useCallback and pass the empty array as second argument as denpendeny.
