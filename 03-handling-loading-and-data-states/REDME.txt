In the brach I learned things like:

1. How to replace then block with async and await from the fetch method. this reduces the code complexcity.
2. managing isLoding state I am able to use conditional rendering of the component. while fetching data from the
server if takes time than we can add a loader for better user interface.

3. Learned how to hanlde errors using try and catch blocks.
