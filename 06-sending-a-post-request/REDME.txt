Learned how to post data using dummy api that is Firebase. 

Firebase : Firebase is a service providered by Google, which we can use without 
writing any code. Unlike the name implies, it's not some kind of database. 
it is backend that comes together with a database a complete rest API to which
we can send request.

posting data to the server using fetch method we have to pass to arguments to the fetch method
one is API url weher we want to send data and second is an object with some key values, like
method: that is by defautl "GET" but we use "POST" for sending data.
body: content that we want to send over the server like it could be array of form data submitted.
headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
